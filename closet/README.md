# Chi's Lean Closet

In which the original files you were promised in the [project README](/README.md) are contained.

- I just copy pasted these from wherever they were hiding on my computer(s), so plenty here is unfinished.
    - wait, there might be some project euler spoilers... fine, i'll delete those.
- If you want to read lots of comments from my present, most perspicacious self, you're in the wrong place.
    - If you want to read incomprehensible gibberish comments from one of my 4am selves there's probably a wealth of that in here so go wild.
        - But don't hold me liable if you click on a random file and the first comment you read is me threatening to like, become the Joker and blow up Parliament. Or something.
        <!-- TODO: is that what the joker does? factcheck -->
    - OK, don't go getting your hopes up for *lots* of comments anywhere.

### Why do you keep out-of-date nibbles in your closet? Won't that attract ants?

...Don't think about it too hard.
