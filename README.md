# Chi's Lean Nibbles

## Basics (any%)

This repository is a place to put isolated projects I've worked on in Lean, and a scratchpad of sorts. Decided to share it publicly cause why not.

## Basics (all dialogue)

Much of this stuff depends on [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4), and was written using whatever version was latest at the time. Mathlib moves fast, so proof scripts are liable to need fixing over time, at least if you want to use the newest features.

I've included the original files where relevant so as to, I don't know, publicly humiliate myself, but at time of writing I also plan on maintaining updated versions of everything which compile with the Lean version and Mathlib commit this repo is using. (Which can be found in [``lean-toolchain``](lean-toolchain) and [``lake-manifest.json``](lake-manifest.json); note that the former is fixed by the latter.) No guarantees about trying to keep the translations 1-to-1.

I guess this plan means that whenever I want to use the latest Mathlib for something and put it in this repo, I now have the baggage of updating everything. Oh well. Let's find out how annoying that gets... together!

## How to snoop around

Uhh, maybe some day I'll get around to writing a tutorial for cloning this and interacting with the proof state. I dunno. You can read and use the Internet, right? I'm sure you'll be fine.
